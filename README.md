# LabVIEW Code for Amperometry and Coulometry

## Overview
This LabVIEW program is designed to interface Bioanalytical Systems CV-27 Voltammograph with a National Instruments (NI) data acquisition card to perform Amperometry and Coulometry measurement. It allows users to set up and run amperometry and coulometry measurements, visualize data, and save the results for further analysis.

This code is developed for use in **CHEM 426/526 Instrumental Analysis** at the **University of Washington**. 

## Features
- **Potentiostat Integration**: Connects to a potentiostat through an NI data acquisition card.
- **Amperometry and Coulometry Parameter Configuration**: Users can set up below parameters for their measurements: applied voltage(finish voltage), time 
- **Data Visualization**: Displays raw current vs time and charge vs time data after the measurement.
 - **Data Saving**: Users can save both raw data in the format of .csv or .txt for further analysis.
