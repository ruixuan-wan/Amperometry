# README: LabVIEW Code for Amperometry and Coulometry

## Overview
This LabVIEW program is designed to interface Bioanalytical Systems CV-27 Voltammograph with a National Instruments (NI) data acquisition card to perform Amperometry and Coulometry. It allows users to set up and run electrochemical measurements, visualize data, and save the results for further analysis.

This code is developed for use in **CHEM 426/526 Instrumental Analysis** at the **University of Washington**. 

## Features
- **Potentiostat Integration**: Connects to a potentiostat through an NI data acquisition card.
- **Amperometry and Coulometry Parameter Configuration**: Users can set up key parameters for their measurements.
- **Data Visualization**:
  - Displays raw current and charge data during the measurement.
  - Provides processed data for analysis.
- **Data Saving**: Users can save both raw and processed data for further analysis.

## Installation and Setup
1. **Connect Hardware**:
   - Ensure the potentiostat is properly connected to the NI DAQ card.
   - Verify that the DAQ card is recognized by LabVIEW.
2. **Load the LabVIEW Code**:
   - Open the LabVIEW project file.
3. **Configure Measurement Parameters**:
   - Set up the required parameters for Amperometry or Coulometry.
4. **Run the Program**:
   - Start the measurement and observe real-time data.
5. **Save Results**:
   - Export the data for further processing and analysis.
